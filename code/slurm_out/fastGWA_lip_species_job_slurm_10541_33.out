Sampling variance/covariance of the estimates of Vg and Ve:
 0.118175 -0.118761
-0.118761  0.120451

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	5.59639e-17	0.343765
Ve	0.907639	0.34706
Vp	0.907639

Heritability = 6.16588e-17 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.134517 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

Performing fastGWA linear regression analysis...
fastGWA results will be saved in text format to [/data100t1/home/wanying/CCHC/lipidomics/output/traininig_set_lipid_species_GWAS/CE-18:1-.fastGWA].
  Filtering out variants with MAF < 0.0001, customise it with --maf flag.
  Filtering out variants with missingness rate > 0.10, customise it with --geno flag.
