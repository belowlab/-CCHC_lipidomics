-0.130353  0.132833

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	6.10009e-17	0.359431
Ve	0.98933	0.364463
Vp	0.98933

Heritability = 6.16588e-17 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.0851152 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
