Heritability = 0.339814 (Pval = 0.359592)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.0856097 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
