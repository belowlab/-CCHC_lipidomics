Source	Variance	SE
Vg	7.09574e-16	0.272202
Ve	0.959006	0.27774
Vp	0.959006

Heritability = 7.39905e-16 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.0892874 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
