Sampling variance/covariance of the estimates of Vg and Ve:
 0.129761 -0.130299
-0.130299  0.131909

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	1.12818e-15	0.360223
Ve	0.914861	0.363193
Vp	0.914861

Heritability = 1.23318e-15 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.122646 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
