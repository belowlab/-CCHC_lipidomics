Source	Variance	SE

Ve	0.755391	0.254039
Vp	0.755391

Heritability = 1.20851e-14 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.0863806 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
