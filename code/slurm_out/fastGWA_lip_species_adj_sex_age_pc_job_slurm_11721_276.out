Sampling variance/covariance of the estimates of Vg and Ve:
 0.118698 -0.119164
-0.119164  0.120654

Source	Variance	SE
Vg	1.87492e-15	0.344525
Ve	0.894351	0.347353
Vp	0.894351

Heritability = 2.0964e-15 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.138312 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
