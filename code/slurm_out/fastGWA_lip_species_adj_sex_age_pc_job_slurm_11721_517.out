Source	Variance	SE

Ve	0.836024	0.308868
Vp	0.836024

Heritability = 6.16588e-17 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.0854907 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.

fastGWA results will be saved in text format to [/data100t1/home/wanying/CCHC/lipidomics/output/traininig_set_lipid_species_GWAS/PE-18:0_20:3-_-a-.fastGWA].
  Filtering out variants with MAF < 0.0001, customise it with --maf flag.
  Filtering out variants with missingness rate > 0.10, customise it with --geno flag.
