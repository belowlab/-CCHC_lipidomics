Vg	2.11333e-14	0.347729
Ve	0.946812	0.35148
Vp	0.946812

Heritability = 2.23205e-14 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.105801 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
