Source	Variance	SE
Vg	7.55672e-14	0.25553
Ve	0.830333	0.259975
Vp	0.830333

Heritability = 9.10083e-14 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.140585 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
