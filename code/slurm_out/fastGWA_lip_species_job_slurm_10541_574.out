Source	Variance	SE
Vg	5.28594e-17	0.223259
Ve	0.857289	0.227856
Vp	0.857289

Heritability = 6.16588e-17 (Pval = 1)
fastGWA-REML runtime: 0.108658 sec.
Warning: the estimate of Vg is not statistically significant. This is likely because the number of closely related individuals in the sample is not large enough. 
In this case, the program will use linear regression for association test.
